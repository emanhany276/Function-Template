## Graduation Project: Development of a Numeric Library in Modern C++
### Project Objective:
-To design and implement a versatile numeric library utilizing the power of Modern C++ templates, demonstrating a solid understanding of template programming, arithmetic operations, and operator overloading.

### Core Features:
-Numeric Operations: The library will feature the following key numeric operations:
-max: Returns the maximum value among its arguments.
-min: Returns the minimum value among its arguments.
-sub: Returns the difference between its arguments.

### Template Programming
-All functions must be implemented using C++ templates, allowing them to accept one or more parameters of arithmetic data types (e.g., int, float, double).
-Arithmetic Data Types Support: The functions should work exclusively with arithmetic data types, demonstrating the library's focus on numeric operations.

### Custom Data Type Support:
-Implement support for a custom data type named Custom, which includes a specific behavior for the sub function.
